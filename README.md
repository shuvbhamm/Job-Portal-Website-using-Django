Hey folks, I have created a job portal site, where companies can register themselves, and after registration ADMIN can approve or reject the company based on their given data. <br>
After getting approved COMPANIES can add jobs to the website for applicants to register.<br>
This website comes with 3 login views, USER, COMPANIES, ADMIN. <br>
